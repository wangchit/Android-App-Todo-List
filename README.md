# Android-App-Todo-List

• The task title and due date must be entered before they are saved. Feedback is given to the user (via a Toast) if they add a task without
this information.

• Customized layout is designed in row.xml.

• Tasks are saved in SQLite db database file.

• Display the “additional information” in a dialog when the list item is clicked. Remove an item by long clicking on it
